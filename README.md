# TMDB app

This SPA is made as a practice and an introduction to Svelte from its basic project template (https://github.com/sveltejs/template) and then modified as instructed by Toomuch Waythemfart, a developer and teacher from Sweden.

It connects to the [TMDB database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and fetches some data about recent movie releases. Deploys to Netlify in the last step. It's a nice course.
